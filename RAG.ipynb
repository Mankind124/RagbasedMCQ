            "\n",
            "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a broad  term encompassing a range of conditions affecting the heart and blood vessels. It's  like an umbrella term for problems with your body's circulatory system.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Here's a simpler explanation:** Imagine your circulatory system as a network of highways  with your heart as the central hub. CVD is like damage or blockage on these highways, making it difficult for blood to flow smoothly. \n",
            "\n",
            "**Types of  Cardiovascular Disease:**\n",
            "\n",
            "Here are some of the most common types:\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Coronary artery disease (CAD):** The most common type, CAD occurs when plaque builds up in the coronary arteries (the highways supplying blood to the heart  muscle), narrowing them and restricting blood flow. This can lead to chest pain (angina) and heart attacks.\n",
            "* **Stroke:** Occurs when blood flow to the brain is interrupted, either by a blockage (ischemic stroke)  or a burst blood vessel (hemorrhagic stroke). This can cause brain damage and long-term disabilities.\n",
            "* **Heart failure:**  This doesn't mean the heart stops beating. Instead, it means the heart can't pump blood effectively enough to meet the body's needs. This can cause  fatigue, shortness of breath, and fluid buildup.\n",
            "* **Arrhythmia:** Refers to irregular heart rhythms, which can be too fast, too slow, or erratic. While some arrhythmias are harmless, others can be serious and even life-threatening.\n",
            "* **Congenital heart defects:**  These are  heart problems present at birth, ranging from minor to severe. They occur due to problems with the heart's structure and can affect blood flow.\n",

            "* **Modifiable risk factors:**  High blood pressure, high cholesterol, smoking, diabetes, obesity, physical inactivity, unhealthy diet, stress\n",

            "**Prevention and Management:**\n",
            "\n",

            "Here are some key steps:\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Healthy diet:** Eat plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Limit saturated and trans fats, cholesterol, sodium, and added sugars.\n",
            "* **Regular exercise:** Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of  the week.\n",
            "* **Maintain a healthy weight:**  Losing even a small amount of weight can make a big difference.\n",
            "* **Quit smoking:**  Smoking is a major risk factor for CVD. \n",
            "* **Manage existing conditions:**  Keep your blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar levels under control.  \n",
            "* **Regular checkups:** Visit your doctor for regular checkups, even if you feel healthy.\n",
            "\n",

The pain started  30 minutes ago while he was mowing the lawn and has persisted since. He is diaphoretic and short of breath. His past medical history is significant  for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a 20-pack-year smoking history. He reports his father died of a \"heart attack\" at age  55.
